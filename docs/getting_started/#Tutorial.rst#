Running a pipeline - Tutorial
=============================

Before beginning this tutorial plase make sure you have cgat-showcase installed correctly, please see here (see :ref:`getting_started-Installation`) for instructions.

As a tutorial example we have written a showcase example of how you can build robust and scalable pipelines
written in python. For this toy example we have written a workflow that performs pseudocounting using kallisto and differential expression
analysis using deseq. Two reports are then generated, one using `MultiQC <https://multiqc.info/>` and another written in
`Rmarkdown <https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/>`. However, because of the flexible nature of our workflow management system,
any reporting strategy can be implimented.

Tutorial
--------

**1.** First download the tutorial data::

   mkdir showcase
   cd showcase
   wget 
   tar -zxvf 

**2.** Next we will generate a configuration yml file so the pipeline output can be modified::

   cgatshowcase transdiffexpres config

or you can alternatively call the workflow file directly::

   python /path/to/file/pipeline_transdiffexpres.py config

This will generate a yml file containing the configuration parameters than can be used to modify
the output of the pip
