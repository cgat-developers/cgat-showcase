CGAT-showcase contains a showcase example of how to build workflows suing our cgat-core  workflow management system. 
cgat-core allows you to quickly build both simple and complex reproducible pipelines completely within python. 

CGAT-core is  a set of libraries and helper functions used to enable researchers
to design and build computational workflows for the analysis of large-scale data-analysis. Access to code is
through `github <https://github.com/cgat-developers/cgat-showcase>`_ and documentation can be accessed `here <https://cgat-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

Used in combination with CGAT-apps, we have deomonstrated the functionality of our
flexible implementation using a set of well documented, easy to install and easy to use workflows, which we descibe in this documentation.

CGAT-core is open-sourced, powerful and user-friendly, and has been continually developed
as a Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) workflow management system over the past 10 years.
